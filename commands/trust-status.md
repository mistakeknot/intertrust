description: Show agent trust scores — precision, review counts, and suppression candidates
argument-hint: "[agent-name]"
---

Display agent trust and reputation scores across projects. Shows which agents are producing useful findings and which are wasting tokens.

## Workflow

### 1. Load Trust Data

```bash
INTERTRUST_PLUGIN=$(find ~/.claude/plugins/cache -path "*/intertrust/*/hooks/lib-trust.sh" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
if [[ -z "$INTERTRUST_PLUGIN" ]]; then
    echo "Intertrust plugin not found. Trust scoring requires the intertrust companion plugin."
    exit 0
fi
source "$INTERTRUST_PLUGIN"
```

### 2. Display Report

If an agent name is provided as argument, show that agent's scores across all projects using `_trust_score "<agent>" "<project>"` for each known project.

Otherwise, run `_trust_report` to show the full table of all agents and projects.

### 3. Highlight Suppression Candidates

After the report, list agents with trust < 0.30 on the current project:

> These agents are candidates for suppression. Their findings are rarely accepted. Consider:
> - Reviewing their domain match for this project type
> - Checking if their prompts need domain-specific tuning
> - Using `/interspect:interspect-propose` to create routing overrides

### 4. Show Recommendations

If any agent has trust > 0.90 with 10+ reviews:
> High-trust agents: These consistently produce actionable findings. Consider prioritizing them in Stage 1 dispatch.
